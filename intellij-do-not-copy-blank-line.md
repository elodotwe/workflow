IntelliJ by default will copy the entire line (even if blank!) if you hit `Ctrl+C` with nothing selected.

This is a terrible default and has cut me several times.

It can be disabled [per these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32907749):

> Invoke `Help` | `Find Action...` (`Ctrl (Cmd on Mac)+Shift+A`), type `Registry` and select the `Registry...` item that appears. Enable the `editor.skip.copy.and.cut.for.empty.selection` option there.
